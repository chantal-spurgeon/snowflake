"""
Snowflake Cost Explorer
------------------------
A Streamlit app for monitoring and breaking down monthly Snowflake costs by
category (compute, storage, AI/Cortex, replication, egress), with drill-downs
by warehouse, query tag, user, and role (with optional department rollups).

AI Services costs are sourced from Snowflake's dedicated Cortex Account Usage
views (CORTEX_AI_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY, CORTEX_ANALYST_USAGE_HISTORY,
CORTEX_AGENT_USAGE_HISTORY) rather than inferred from QUERY_HISTORY text
matching, giving real per-call credit/token figures. User/query tag/role
attribution on Cortex usage is only available for usage on or after
2026-02-16; earlier usage is included in totals but shown as "unattributed"
in the user/role breakdowns.

Data source: SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE views (requires ACCOUNTADMIN or a role
granted the IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database, or the
ORGANIZATION_USAGE-equivalent grants for ACCOUNT_USAGE).

This app is designed to run in EITHER of two modes, auto-detected at startup:
  1. Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS) — deployed via CREATE STREAMLIT and opened
     in Snowsight. Uses the app's own active session automatically; no
     credentials needed. See README.md for deployment steps.
  2. Standalone / local — run with `streamlit run app.py` outside Snowflake.
     Uses a login form in the sidebar (or demo data with no connection at
     all) to build a Snowpark session.

Run standalone with:
    streamlit run app.py

        figure is TOKEN_CREDITS (token-based agent costs only — this
        excludes METADATA:sql_query_credits, the warehouse compute an agent's
        SQL tool calls incurred, since that's warehouse cost already counted
        elsewhere, not Cortex-specific cost).
