-- Once you have query ID, pull in Query History and look at the query profile.
-- Queuing Time: Time waiting for a compute slot. May need to add additional clusters to WH, or set STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS to abort runaway queries.
-- Cartesian products (exploding joins): Query problem. Look at adding some WHERE conditions, or use a different join type.
-- Disk Spillage: Resources are too low for the work required. Increase compute (WH size) or look at ways to limit amount of data sorted. Use GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT to lower sort overhead.
-- Excessive Scan: If no cluster keys are present, they may need to be added. If they are present, they may need to be readjusted (see cluster scripts). Avoid SELECT * and limit to only required columns.
